# ⚖️ Legal System

> The Legal System is the organized set of principles, institutions, norms, and procedures through which a society defines, interprets, and enforces justice.
It links social order, state authority, and moral reasoning within a coherent institutional framework.
Every national legal system reflects its historical path, constitutional design, and cultural foundations.

| **Civil Law System**     | Based on codified statutes and comprehensive legal codes (e.g., France, Dominican Republic, Spain). Judicial decisions interpret but do not create law.                    |
| **Common Law System**    | Rooted in judicial precedent and case law (e.g., United Kingdom, United States). Judges play a central role in shaping the law through decisions.                          |
| **Customary Law System** | Derived from unwritten traditions, social norms, and community practices — often coexisting with formal law (e.g., parts of Africa and Oceania).                           |
| **Religious Law System** | Founded on sacred texts and theological principles (e.g., Sharia in Islamic countries, Halakha in Israel).                                                                 |
| **Mixed Legal System**   | Combines features of multiple traditions, adapting them to national contexts (e.g., Dominican Republic — civil law base with constitutional and international influences). |

| **Dominican Republic** | **Civil Law (Mixed)**          | Rooted in the French civil code tradition, with constitutional and international influences. The system emphasizes codified norms but increasingly integrates judicial interpretation, especially in constitutional matters. |
| **Sweden**             | **Civil Law (Nordic)**         | Characterized by pragmatic codification, strong administrative law, and an emphasis on legality and proportionality. Judicial review is limited but administrative courts play a crucial role in ensuring accountability.    |
| **Spain**              | **Civil Law (Roman–Germanic)** | Structured around comprehensive legal codes and a hierarchical judiciary. Constitutional control is centralized in the *Tribunal Constitucional*, ensuring compatibility of norms with fundamental rights.                   |
| **United Kingdom**     | **Common Law**                 | Based on precedent and judicial reasoning rather than codified law. Parliament is sovereign, but courts interpret statutes and develop case law that shapes legal evolution.                                                 |
